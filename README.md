# Tinker-Board-2-Benchmarks

A repository of benchmark results for tests run on the Tinker Board, Tinker Board 2 and Raspberry Pi 4, 8GB.

Most tests were run using Phoronix, with the exception of glmark2-es2, Octane 2.0, Jetstream 2.0 and calculating pi in the terminal.

glmark2-es2 was built and tested using these parameters: https://tinkerboard_asus.gitbooks.io/tinkerboard-develop-note/content/glmark2.html

Charts were created using the plotext Python library: https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext
